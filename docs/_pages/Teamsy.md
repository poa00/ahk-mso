## About

Teamsy is a Microsoft Teams Plugin for an Application Launcher like [Launchy](http://launchy.net/) or [Executor](http://executor.dk/).
It is also as a Microsoft Teams "Commander" i.e. you can run it from the command line to send commands to Microsoft Teams.
It can be used in that sense as bridge between, for example, a StreamDeck and Microsoft Teams.
