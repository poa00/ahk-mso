## About

Teamsy is a Microsoft Teams *Plugin for an Application Launcher* like [Launchy](http://launchy.net/) or [Executor](http://executor.dk/) as well as a *Teams Commander* i.e. it can also be used from the command line to send commands to Microsoft Teams. For example, as bridge between a StreamDeck and Microsoft Teams.

You can also run Teamsy from the [Teamsy Launcher](Teamsy-Launcher) or the [Teams Shortcuts](Teams-Shortcuts) PowerTool.

Its main advantage is that it works even if your Teams window isn't active (contrary to built-in hotkeys) both for main window and meeting window actions.

## Prerequisites

Teamsy is a available as standalone .exe application. [Download link](https://github.com/tdalon/ahk/raw/master/PowerTools/Teamsy.exe)
You can also run it from its AutoHotkey source [Teamsy.ahk](https://github.com/tdalon/ahk/blob/master/Teamsy.ahk) provided you take all the dependencies/ downlad the [full repository](https://github.com/tdalon/ahk).

You can run Teamsy from the command line.
I personally use Teamsy from an App launcher e.g. [Launchy](http://launchy.net/) or [Executor](http://executor.dk/).
I [recommend](https://tdalon.blogspot.com/2020/08/executor-my-preferred-app-launcher.html) [Executor](http://executor.dk/).
You can download it [here](http://executor.dk/).

### Alternative without application launcher

If you want to run Teamsy without using an application launcher, have a look at [Teams Launcher](Teamsy-Launcher)

## List of supported commands/ Keywords

This is implemented in the main associated library [Lib/Teamsy.ahk](https://github.com/tdalon/ahk/blob/master/Lib/Teamsy.ahk)
Here you can find the syntax for keywords and command. (I hope the code is clear enough.)
