## About

Teamsy is a Microsoft Teams Plugin for an Application Launcher like Launchy or Executor.
It is also as a Microsoft Teams "Commander" i.e. you can run it from the command line to send commands to Microsoft Teams. It can be used in that sense as bridge between, for example, a StreamDeck and Microsoft Teams.
