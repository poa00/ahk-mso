The PowerTools Bundler is available in the PowerTools directory (PowerToolsBundler.exe).

You can [download it](PowerTools-Setup#download-all) with the whole PowerTools suite.

Alternatively, you can download the standalone version by clicking directly [here](https://github.com/tdalon/ahk/raw/master/PowerTools/PowerToolsBundler.exe).
In this case, it is recommended to store the Bundler in a clean separate directory - because all other tools and utilities will be stored on the same level.

## Configuration and ini file

The first time you open the PowerTools Bundler, you will be asked to choose your configuration.
A configuration is a preset of Settings for the PowerTools.
When you load a configuration, the corresponding settings will be stored in the registry and written as well in the PowerTools.ini file.
