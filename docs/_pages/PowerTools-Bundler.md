The PowerTools Bundler is available in the PowerTools directory (PowerToolsBundler.exe).

You can [download it](PowerTools-Setup#download-all) with the whole PowerTools suite.

Alternatively, you can download the standalone version by clicking directly [here](https://github.com/tdalon/ahk/raw/master/PowerTools/PowerToolsBundler.exe).
In this case, it is recommended to store the Bundler in a clean separate directory - because all other tools and utilities will be stored on the same level.
