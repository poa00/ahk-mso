You can download the standalone version by clicking directly [here](https://github.com/tdalon/ahk/raw/master/PowerTools/PowerToolsBundler.exe).

It is recommended to store the Bundler in a clean separate directory - because all other tools and utilities will be stored on the same level.

Changelog is available here [Changelog](PowerTools-Bundler-(Changelog))
